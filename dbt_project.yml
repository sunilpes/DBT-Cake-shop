# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
# models:
#   enabled: true    # configs defined here are applied to _all_ packages
#   materialized: view   # but can be overridden in more specific configs below
#   # pre- and post- hooks can be defined anywhere within the model hierarchy.
#   # when defined at the root level (as they are here), they apply to all models
#   # in all packages. These hooks are compiled into the model SQL and run either
#   # before or after the model is materializated.
#   pre-hook:
#     - "insert into audit (model, state, time) values ('{{ this.name }}', 'start', getdate())"
#   post-hook:
#     - "grant select on {{this}} to user_1"
#     - "insert into audit (model, state, time) values ('{{ this.name }}', 'end', getdate())"
#   # This is the configuration for the models in your local package. The value
#   # for the `name` key (defined above) should be used here
#   dbt_cake_shop:
#     # Applies to all SQL files found under ./models/finance/
#     finance:
#       enabled: false
#       # Applies to the specific model ./models/finance/fct_orders.sql
#       fct_orders:
#         enabled: true
#         materialized: table
